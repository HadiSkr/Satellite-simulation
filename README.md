Satellite Physics Simulation with Three.js

This project is a physics simulation of a satellite using Three.js. The simulation calculates the trajectory of a satellite based on user input parameters such as friction constant, air intensity, pulse force, earth radius, planet mass, and initial speed. The simulation is displayed using Three.js, a JavaScript library that enables the creation of 3D animations and graphics on web browsers.
Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. To install the project dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
npm install

Usage
To start the simulation, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter the simulation parameters, such as friction constant, air intensity, pulse force, earth radius, planet mass, and initial speed. Once you have entered the parameters, click the "Start Simulation" button, and the simulation will begin. You can use the mouse to rotate the camera and zoom in and out.
